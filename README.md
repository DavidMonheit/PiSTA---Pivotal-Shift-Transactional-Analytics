<h1>PiSTA - Pivotal Shift Transactional Analytics</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
"Pivotal Shift Transactional Analytics (PiSTA) is a cutting-edge data analytics platform currently used by the Israeli Defense Forces' Home Front Command unit (Pikud HaOref). Designed to identify and analyze cities with outlier transactional behaviors based on shifts occurring around a pivotal date, PiSTA utilizes advanced algorithms and data science techniques. It effectively segregates transaction data into pre- and post-pivotal date periods, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of transactional dynamics and the identification of significant changes in spending patterns. The system's robust analysis aids in pinpointing cities with unusual transactional behaviors, offering valuable insights for the IDF. PiSTA stands out for its ability to reveal hidden patterns and anomalies in large and complex transactional datasets, making it an essential tool for data-driven decision-making."

<h2>Key Features of PiSTA</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Data Processing and Analysis:</b> PiSTA processes transaction data with a focus on changes occurring before and after a pivotal date, including transaction filtering, data normalization, and pivot table creation for detailed analysis.</li>
<li><b>Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering:</b> Utilizing Isomap for dimensionality reduction and DBSCAN for clustering, PiSTA identifies complex transactional patterns and anomalies.</li>
<li><b>Outlier Detection and Analysis:</b> Expert in detecting outliers, PiSTA is crucial for the Home Front Command to identify unusual activities within large datasets.</li>
<li><b>Visualization Capabilities:</b> Features robust functions for visualizing complex data, including plots of reduced data, clusters, and time series analysis of outliers.</li>
<li><b>Customization and Flexibility:</b> Adjustable parameters like pivot date, threshold percent, and transaction categories allow for tailored analysis based on IDF's specific needs.</li>
<li><b>Data Integrity and Management:</b> Accounts for missing data, ensuring reliable analysis and maintaining data integrity.</li>
</ul>
